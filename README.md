# repeaterdev-js

The official Javascript library for accessing the https://repeater.dev API.

Repeater.dev makes it easy for Jamstack applications to perform asynchronous/background
and recurring job processing. Need to send an email 24 hours after signup? Create a
serverless function that sends that email, then have Repeater issue an HTTP call to
that function in 24 hours.

## Prequisites

You'll need an account at https://repeater.dev and at least one [Application](https://docs.repeater.dev/#getting-started).

## Installation

    yarn add repeaterdev-js

Or

    npm install repeaterdev-js

## Usage

```javascript
import { Repeater } from 'repeaterdev-js'

// or

const { Repeater } = require('repeaterdev-js')
```

Initialize `Repeater` with an [Application Token](https://docs.repeater.dev/#getting-started)
and get back an instance that you'll use to make all calls:

```javascript
const repeater = new Repeater('8ac0be4c06836527b63543ca70a84cb5')
```

### Enqueuing a Job

You can enqueue [jobs](https://docs.repeater.dev/#jobs) and tell them when to run. If you
leave `runAt` blank then the job will run as soon as possible:

```javascript
repeater.enqueue({
  name: 'sample-job',
  endpoint: 'https://mysite.com/api/sample',
  verb: 'POST'
}).then(job => {
  console.log(job)
})

// or

const job = await repeater.enqueue({
  name: 'sample-job',
  endpoint: 'https://mysite.com/api/sample',
  verb: 'POST'
})
console.log(job)
```

In the example above the call to `enqueue` will be a Promise that resolves once the job is successfully
enqueued. Note the actual running of the job is asynchronousâ€”you will need to query separately
to check on the status of an existing job (see [Retrieving Job Results](#retrieving-jobresults)).

In the above example, when the job runs, Repeater will issue an HTTP POST request to `https://mysite.com/api/sample` and record the [result](#retrieving-jobresults).

#### Parameter Notes

For convenience, the `headers` property can be set as a JSON object. It will automatically be serialized to a string for you.

`body` should be set as a string, but if you use the `json` key instead then the values will be serialized to a string automatically, and a `Content-Type: application/json` header will be added to `headers`:

```javascript
const job = await repeater.enqueue({
  name: 'sample-job',
  endpoint: 'https://mysite.com/api/sample',
  verb: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer ABCD1234' },
  json: { data: { user: { id: 434 } } }
})

// variables set on GraphQL call become:

{
  name: "sample-job",
  endpoint: "https://mysite.com/api/sample",
  verb: "POST",
  headers: "{\"Authorization\":\"Bearer ABCD1234\",\"Content-Type\":\"application/json\"}",
  body: "{\"data\":{\"user\":{\"id\":434}}}"
}
```

`runAt` should be a Javascript Date. It will be converted to UTC before the job is enqueued.
If you don't specify a `runAt` when calling `enqueue()` then the job will be set to run now,
meaning as soon as the Repeater.dev processing queue can get to it.

By default, `enabled` and `retryable` are set to `true`.

### Listing Existing Jobs

Return all currently available jobs for the application:

```javascript
repeater.jobs().then(jobs => {
  console.log(jobs)
})

// or

const jobs = await repeater.jobs()
console.log(jobs)
```

### Retrieving a Single Job

Return a single job by name:

```javascript
repeater.job('job-name').then(job => {
  console.log(job)
})

// or

const job = await repeater.job('job-name')
console.log(job)
```

### Retrieving JobResults

You can check on the [results](https://docs.repeater.dev/#jobresults) of any jobs that have run
by calling `results()` an an instance of a job:

```javascript
repeater.job('sample-job')
  .then(job => job.results())
  .then(results => console.log(job.results))

// or

const job = await repeater.job('sample-job')
const results = await job.results()
console.log(results)
```

`results` will be an array with one member for each time the job has run.

### Editing a Job

First we get the existing job details by using the job's name and then update that
job once the Promise resolves:

```javascript
repeater.job('sample-job').then(job => {
  job.update({ runAt: '2022-01-01T12:00:00Z' })
})

// or

const job = await repeater.job('sample-job')
await job.update({ runAt: '2022-01-01T12:00:00Z' })
```

When updating a job, any pending job runs are canceled and rescheduled
(if the job is `enabled`) based on the values in `runAt` and `runEvery`.

After running, the job instance will be updated with the new value(s) that were
just saved:

```javascript
const job = await repeater.job('sample-job')
job.verb // => 'GET'
await job.update({ verb: 'POST' })
job.verb // => 'POST'
```

> Note that you cannot rename an existing job. If you really need to give a job
> a new name you'll need to delete the existing job and create a new one.

### Deleting a Job

First look up the job by name and then issue the delete:

```javascript
repeater.job('sample-job').then(job => {
  job.delete()
})

// or

const job = await repeater.job('sample-job')
await job.delete()
```

You can tell if a Job instance represents a deleted job by checking
the `isDeleted` property:

```javascript
const job = await repeater.job('sample-job')
job.isDeleted // => false
await job.delete()
job.isDeleted // => true
```

Once a job has been deleted, calls to `update()`, `delete()` or `results()` will throw
a `ReadOnlyError`.
