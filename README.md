# repeater-js

The official Javascript library for accessing the https://repeater.dev API.

## Installation

    yarn add repeaterdev-js
    npm install repeaterdev-js

## Usage

```javascript
import Repeater from 'repeaterdev-js'
// or
const Repeater = require('repeaterdev-js')
```

Initialize Repeater with an [Application Token](https://docs.repeater.dev/#getting-started):

```javascript
const repeater = new Repeater('8ac0be4c06836527b63543ca70a84cb5')
```

### Enqueuing a Job

Now you can enqueue [jobs](https://docs.repeater.dev/#jobs) and tell them when to run. If you
leave `runAt` blank then the job will run as soon as possible:

```javascript
repeater.enqueue({
  name: 'sample-job',
  endpoint: 'https://mysite.com/api/sample',
  verb: 'POST'
}).then(job => {
  console.log(job)
})
```

In the example above the call to `enqueue` will be a Promise that resolves once the job is successfully
enqueued. Note the actual running of the job is asynchronousâ€”you will need to query separately
to check on the status of an existing job (see [Checking on Job Status](#checking-on-job-status)).

When the job runs, Repeater will issue a POST request to `https://mysite.com/api/sample` and
record the result.

### Checking on Job Status

You can check on the [results](https://docs.repeater.dev/#jobresults) of any jobs that have run:

```javascript
repeater.job('sample-job').then(job => {
  job.results()
}).then(results => {
  console.log(job.results)
})

// or

const job = await repeater.job('sample-job')
const results = await job.results()
console.log(results)
```

`results` will be an array with one member for each time the job has run.

### Editing a Job

First we get the existing job details by using the job's name and then update that
job once the Promise resolves:

```javascript
repeater.job('sample-job').then(job => {
  job.update({ runAt: '2022-01-01T12:00:00Z' })
})

// or

const job = await repeater.job('sample-job')
job.update({ runAt: '2022-01-01T12:00:00Z' })
```

### Deleting a Job

First look up the job by name and then issue the delete:

```javascript
repeater.job('sample-job').then(job => {
  job.delete()
})

// or

const job = await repeater.job('sample-job')
job.delete()
```
